\description{Collapses counts along equal levels of binned covariates.}
\usage{collapse(x,v,nquant=NULL)}
\arguments{
	\item{x}{Either matrix or Matrix of multinomial counts.}
	\item{v}{Either matrix or Matrix of covariates.}
	\item{nquant}{The number of quantile bins into which we collapse \code{v}.  \code{nquant=NULL} does no collapsing. }
}
\details{
	For each column of \code{v}, aggregates
	the observations into \code{nquant} bins defined by their average value.  Both \code{v} and \code{x} are then collapsed according to levels of the interaction across implied bin-factors.
}
\value{A list containing collapsed and formatted \code{x} and \code{v}.}
